                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>The Robotics Toolbox (RTB) (The brainchild of Peter Corke) provides a range of functions that are useful
                        in the study and simulation of classical arm-type robotics including kinematics, dynamics and trajectory
                        generation. The current RTB is designed for use within MATLAB consisting of a range of scripts using
                        .m-files and has been used in a wide range of applications including research and teaching. With
                        the RTB currently in its 10th release the toolbox provides users with mature code, straightforward
                        algorithms and high-level documentation including “Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB release 9” and the
                        in-depth book “Robotics, Vision and Control.” While the RTB has been designed for MATLAB, the high
                        financial implications of obtaining a MATLAB license is a barrier for current and future users to
                        access the toolbox. While the RTB can be used in Octave, an open source mathematical environment
                        and there has been attempts to create a python implementation, thus far none of these options have
                        been true replacements for the MATLAB version. Therefor this project will seek to redesign the RTB
                        for python allowing for a majority of the functionality of the toolbox to be used in Python. As Python
                        is developed under an open source license the software is more accessible and therefor widens the
                        range of access to the RTB. Secondly via creating a Python RTB users are given options in which language
                        they can use the with the RTB. Finally, as the RTB has been developed over 20 years and has code
                        written in a straightforward manner for the ease of understanding, the computational efficiency of
                        the RTB has suffered and therefor via the porting of the toolbox the code can be re-designed to ensure
                        computational efficiency while maintaining ease of understanding for the user. </p>

                    <p>In a preface to his posthumous collection, Owen said his poems were about the pity of war, not the “glory,
                        honour, might, majesty, dominion, or power" that war poems traditionally addressed. "Strange Meeting"
                        contains this phrase in the context of a subterranean meeting of a soldier and the enemy he killed.
                        The enemy soldier ruminates on how the truth of war - the pity of it - is quelled when the soldiers
                        die. Those back at home, those who started the war, do not know what it is truly like to wait in
                        the trenches, dodge bullets and poison gas attacks, watch their friends die in front of them, and
                        lose their reason and will to endure. Owen felt it was his mission to use his poetry to distill the
                        truth of the war, and his poems stand as beautiful and brilliantly bitter expositions on the horrors
                        of the battlefield and the complexity of the return to the home front.</p>
